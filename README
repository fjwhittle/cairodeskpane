This is the Cairo Desk Pane project, by Francis Whittle.

It's a desktop window divided into resizable panes into which you can put stuff,
currently limited to terminals (provided by libvte).  In the future more options
will be available via a plug-in system.

Dependencies:
Gtk+-3.0
VTE-2.90

Compile with
gcc -o cairodeskpane $(pkg-config --libs --cflags gtk+-3.0 vte-2.90) *.c
